  ## Emotional Well-being and Mental Health


  I still remember when I was a student, on being asked about a topic, I had
  selected ‘Stress’. On this, the examiner had exclaimed that everyone was
  stressed. Now post-pandemic, when we are settling back to our regular life,
  there is a new definition for stress which relates us back to our mental
  health. If you google the definition of mental health, it will define the term
  as the ability to cope with stress and showcase the ability to learn new
  skills in life. In this course, the real challenge comes up with the
  well-being of the emotional state of our mind.


  In today’s time, [emotional well-being and good mental
  health](https://www.glentreeacademy.com/blogs/emotional-well-being-and-mental-health
  "Emotional Wellbeing and Mental Health") refer to people of all ages. But the
  rising amount of lack of good mental health is increasing amongst one group of
  individuals – the youngsters or the students.

  Due to the rising amount of emotional pressure amongst the students, it is not
  late enough to examine the reasons behind the cause of mental unrest among the
  students. The rush in the need for good academic performances and the
  competitive spirit amongst the students to excel one another in order to
  achieve success has resulted in the amount of mental pressure. Data says that
  over 60% of the girls and 40% of the boys feel tensed while appearing for
  examinations even if they are well-prepared. Moreover, the advent of mobile
  phones and the internet has created a sensation amongst adolescents. This has
  absorbed more time in spending digitally.

  Now, comes the question of why should we consider emotional well-being amongst
  students especially adolescents as so important. In order to attain a healthy
  lifestyle which is required for the steady growth of the individual. This can
  only be possible through the joint ventures of the school and the parents. The
  school can implement it through their curriculum.


  Let us have an understanding of the role played by the schools in upgrading
  the mental health and emotional well-being of the students, especially the
  adolescents through the approach taken by certain [Best CBSE schools in
  Bangalore](https://www.glentreeacademy.com/ "Best CBSE Schools in Bangalore").
  Schools like the Glentree Academy in
  [Whitefield](https://www.glentreeacademy.com/glentree-whitefield "Schools in
  Whitefield") or Sarjapur adopt certain measures which bring out holistic
  improvement within a child. It is a very responsible task for such schools to
  create a curriculum where the lessons are not presented in a traditional
  manner. Instead, the lessons are presented in a unique manner where

  the usage of the techniques of activity-based learning and digital learning is
  involved. Here in [Glentree Academy](https://www.glentreeacademy.com/ "Best
  Schools in Bangalore"), based in Whitefield, [Sarjapur
  Road](https://www.glentreeacademy.com/glentree-sarjapur "Schools in Sarjapur
  Road") and in the upcoming branch in [Bannerghata
  Road](https://www.glentreeacademy.com/glentree-bannerghatta "Schools in
  Bannerghatta Road"), activities are included in the form of Weightless
  Wednesdays where students spend an entire day once a month without any form of
  textual learning.

  Furthermore, the incorporated activities in the daily lessons which serve the
  overall growth of the students serve as an additional boost for the relief
  from the textual learning. Such curriculums where the students learn LFL –
  lessons for life would provide a different approach to learning. Such a form
  of learning proves to be an emotional relief for the students where they would
  not feel pressured about their performances in their examinations and as a
  result, shift their focus towards engaging in an unhealthy lifestyle. Learning
  will be received in the form of fun and not as an additional pressure. It is
  very important for all of us, especially the parents and school authorities,
  to design curriculums and plan academics in such a way which would be received
  by the students in the

  form of fun-loving knowledge gain which they would utilize later for achieving
  their goal. The sooner we change our approach, the healthier our students will
  be emotionally.
