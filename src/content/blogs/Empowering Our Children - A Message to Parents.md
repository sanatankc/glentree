  # **Empowering Our Children - A Message to Parents**


  Glentree Academy, one of the leading [CBSE Schools in Sarjapur
  Road](https://www.glentreeacademy.com/glentree-sarjapur "CBSE Schools in
  Sarjapur Road"), emphasises the importance of nurturing independence and
  responsibility in our children. In a rapidly changing world, one of the finest
  gifts that we could give our children is the essence of critical thinking as
  well as problem-solving skills.


  Independence begins with allowing children to make decisions, even if it means
  making mistakes. Mistakes are invaluable learning opportunities. They teach
  resilience, adaptability, and the importance of perseverance. Supporting your
  child during risks and decision-making enables them to solve problems
  naturally and enhances their confidence.


  It is crucial to make children feel that their opinions matter. When children
  know that their thoughts and ideas are valued, they are more likely to engage
  actively and think creatively. Engage in discussions with your child, ask for
  their input on family decisions, and show genuine interest in their
  viewpoints. This helps them to cultivate self-esteem and enables them to take
  ownership of the decisions made by them.


  Expecting commitment from our children is equally important. Whether it’s
  completing their homework, participating in household chores, or pursuing
  hobbies, commitment teaches discipline and time management. These skills are
  the bedrock of personal and academic success.

  ## **Simple Ways to Foster Independence**


  ### Assign Age-Appropriate Chores:


  Give children responsibilities that are suitable for their age, such as
  setting the table, tidying their room, or helping with gardening. This teaches
  them responsibility and the importance of contributing to the household.


  ### Encourage Problem-Solving:


  When faced with challenges, guide your child to think of possible solutions
  rather than solving the problem for them. This fosters critical thinking and
  resilience.


  ### Create a Routine:


  Establish a daily routine that includes time for homework, play, and chores. A
  structured routine helps children manage their time effectively and understand
  the importance of balancing responsibilities.


  In our fast-paced lives, it is tempting to compensate for our absence with
  material goods. But the most important thing a parent can give to their
  children is their time and patience. Play with your child, ask how they are,
  and listen to them as well as support their discovery. Your presence and
  support are essential in nurturing their skills and confidence.
