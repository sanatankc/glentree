      “We started with a vision of the joy of learning. We didn't want our kids
      to continue in formal schools, where rote learning is practised. So we've
      come out with a new philosophy **Learning for Life.”**

      Research shows that involved parents contribute to happier, healthier, and
      more successful children. However, in today's fast-paced world, lack of
      quality parenting time leads to increased pressure on children. We often
      neglect the present moment, consumed by daily crises. Engaging children in
      multiple activities is no substitute for parental presence, despite common
      misconceptions.

      As an educator, my goal is to nurture a growth mindset in children,
      teaching them to embrace failures as opportunities for progress. I strive
      to help them measure their advancement effectively, academically and
      personally. By encouraging a positive attitude towards change and letting
      go of past negative experiences, we can develop their mature thinking from
      an early age. This mindset enables them to persevere through setbacks,
      accept constructive criticism, refine their skills, and view mistakes as
      stepping stones to success.
