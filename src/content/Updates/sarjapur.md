    description: >-
      Nursery kids were taken to a Plant Nursery where our little explorers had
      a fantastic experience. As students wander through the nursery's lush
      greenery, they sharpen their observational skills, making them responsible
      caretakers of the planet. The children learnt about different plants and
      how they grow. From colorful flowers to towering trees, their eyes lit up
      with curiosity and wonder at every turn. It was truly a fun and
      educational day out for our bright young minds.
