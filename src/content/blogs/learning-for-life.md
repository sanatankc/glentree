blog: "## **What is the Learning for Life Curriculum?**\n\nAs the name suggests\_[Learning for Life](https://www.glentreeacademy.com/blogs/learning-for-life \"Learning for Life\"),\_the methodology adopted at Glentree makes academic learning fun and relevant to real-life situations in age-appropriate and grade-specific material. It is not traditional chalk & Talk. It not only makes the students more confident and capable but also gives them an invaluable understanding of how things work in the real world. The program uses age-appropriate, grade-specific lesson plans.\n\n### LFL is a different instruction tool:\n\n1. LFL (Learning for Life) focuses on the concept of “Life Long Learning”.\n2. It is student-centred Inquiry-Based Learning and values students as individuals and teachers as facilitators.\n3. Broad, balanced curriculum, with term-wise lesson plans and day-wise schedule for every unit.\n4. The [curriculum](https://www.glentreeacademy.com/lfl-curriculum/ \"Curriculum\") integrates digital resources and labs (Language labs, Math labs, Science lab kits, Computer Lab and Earth Lab).\n5. VARK model lesson plan, that is suitable for all types of learners.\n6. Field trips, culmination days, celebrations, and special events are an integral part of the curriculum and are incorporated into the same.\n\n### LFL follows an Inquiry-based instructional framework:\n\n* Probing: To ask questions and establish guided thinking\n* Perceiving: To become conscious of the concept and focus on understanding it\n* Problem-solving: Involving in hand-on-activities to deeply look at the concept, analyse it and explain it\n* Perusing: To examine the concept extend it to real-life scenarios and apply it\n\n### Adapting LFL in the classroom:\n\nLFL, instructional strategies are interesting for the teachers to adapt in the classrooms. Different teaching strategies are followed in the classroom, not just the lecture method. Collaborative learning, game-based learning, drama-based pedagogies ETC. are integrated as part of classroom teaching, which makes the learning experience very different from rote learning. This way of teaching suits all kinds of learners, whether they are visual, auditory or kinesthetic.\n\nIn the current scenario, nothing is predictable. Online learning is the only key so that students are engaged while at home. The academic program planned using the LFL curriculum framework can be easily followed in virtual classrooms. In fact, it has opened up a lot of avenues for learning, where many tools have been discovered that can bring about the classroom experience virtually.\n\nIn short, LFL IS\_a COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATED CURRICULUM, where apart from academics, all the practical lessons for life like critical thinking, conflict resolution, problem-solving, emotional balance, social skills and most importantly character formation are focused.\n\n– by\_Sowmia Raguraman,\_Principal, Glentree Academy – Sarjapur Road\n"
